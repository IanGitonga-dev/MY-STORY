    <p>I was born in Nairobi at Nairobi hospital on the 21st of February<br>
       2001.we currently live in Nairobi at Garden estate Nairobi<br>
       county. I started school in 2003 at Wankan Academy where i did<br>
       my kindergaten till 2006. I then moved to St Mary's Ruaraka<br>
       in Zimmerman where i studied till class 6 then moved to Spring<br>
       View Academy where i completed my primary school education in 2015.<br>
       I then moved to Ikuu Boys High School where i joined in 2016 as a<br>
       "Mono".Although i was told high school was not a hard as primary,<br>
       neither was it a walk in the park.We would go to sleep after everyone<br>
       was asleep and leave before everyone woke up.This was to avoid monolization.<br>
       Form one was one of the longest years in my entire lifetime.<br>
       In form two i joined the football school team where we got<br>
       to the regionals then got eliminated in the semi-final in a 7-1 defeat.<br>
       this year was also unusually long since my routine was "eat,drink,sleep,play"repeat.
       i really never had much to do in school.i was also always ready for an event or any
       opportunity to leave School it eventually got to an end and i joined form three.
       my whole squad was happy since we could not be disturbed by anyone since
       we were second in rank in school.since we were not disturbed,that year
       was very unevetful.

       we then joined form four where all my drama began.
       my whole squad was suspended on the first day since we came late and
        no one had done the assignment.we stayed home for a week
       so as to finish the homework.we then went back to school and resumed our
        studies.as we went for midterm, the car wew were in was caught and we went
         to the police station
